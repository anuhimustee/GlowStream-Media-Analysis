![](https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dashboard1.png)


## Introduction

Truth be told, Netflix is one of the biggest streaming platforms out there and they are really making big waves and massive moves. Not just that, the entertainment industry is constantly growing and the most interesting is that data (unprocessed information)
as I like to call it) plays a crucial role in decision-making. 
In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst at GlowStream Media, a private entertainment company planning to launch a new show by analyzing the trends and performance of blockbuster movies from 2015-2023.
Unlike typical movies review shows, GlowStream wants to avoid subjective opinions and focus on data-driven insights. They aim to explore themes like box office performance, audience demographics, critical receptions, and streaming platform popularity.

### Project Overview

**GlowStream Media** is a private entertainment company planning to launch a new show **analyzing the trends and performance of blockbuster movies** from 2015 to 2023. Unlike typical movie review shows, GlowStream wants to avoid subjective opinions and focus on **data-driven insights**. They aim to explore themes like **box office performance**, **audience demographics**, **critical reception**, and **streaming platform** popularity.
Here, I assumed the role of a data analyst at GlowStream Media, and my task is to generate meaningful insights using historical movie data.
Since this analysis could influence future content strategies, I am to collaborate with the manager, Mr Emmanuel Ehosa, who has provided a list of questions (which are problem statements also and what they are seeking insights into) to guide my analysis.
My final report or insight will be delivered to GlowStream's Chief Content Officer, Ndidi Chigozie, who values storytelling, clear visuals, and concise insights. 

### Objective
Fundamentally, GlowStream Media aims to launch a unique movie analysis show based purely on data-driven insights rather than subjective reviews. 
Therefore, in this project, my aim is to explore trends in blockbuster movies from 2015 to 2023, providing valuable insights into factors influencing box office success and audience engagement. 
In analyzing any data, the first and the most important aspect is to carefully, strategically & analytically understand the objects and the end goal. 

### About the Dataset:
The dataset used for this project was of a three (3) different table data structure that was used for this analysis. Each of these dataset table structure brief information is outlined below 

Three datasets were used for analysis:

1.	**Movie Box Office Data-:** Contains a total record of 423 (_Before Cleaning/Analysis_) and 8 fields including; movie details, box office revenue, production budget, genre, etc.
Here is a Snapshot of the raw dataset.

Each dataset required cleaning due to issues like _missing values_, _inconsistent formatting_, _duplicate entries_, and _typos_.


## Problem Statement
Mr Emmanel Ehosa who is the manager at GlowStream Media has provided me with key questions to answer for my analysis. The answers to these questions are given birth of the problem statement and prospect that GlowStream intend to embark on which launch a new show. The answers to these questions will unlock a comprehensive insight into **trends and performance of blockbuster movies** from 2015-2023 based on the datasets provided. 

1.	What are the top 5 highest-grossing movies between 2015 and 2023? 
2.	Which genres have the highest average box office revenue? 
3.	What is the relationship between production budget and box office gross? 
4.	Which movies had the highest audience ratings on streaming platforms? 
5.	What age group gave the highest average ratings for each genre? 
6.	Are there any trends in box office performance over the years? 
7.	Which movies received the highest critical review scores? 
8.	What are the most popular viewing platforms for different genres? 
9.	How does audience gender distribution vary by genre? 
10.	Which directors have the highest average box office revenue?

## Concepts/Skills Demonstrated
The following Data Analysis Skill plus Excel features were incorporated during the run down of this project.
•	**Data Importation:** Importing multiple data into Excel
•	**Data Cleaning** (handling missing values, duplicates, formatting inconsistencies)
•	**Data Transformation** (restructuring datasets for better analysis)
•	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies)
•	**Data Visualization** (charts and graphs for insights presentation)
•	 Excel **Pivot Table** for Analysis
•	 Excel **Interactive Dashboard Design**

## Data Transformation/Cleaning
The raw dataset that was used for this analysis project was extremely dirty in the sense that  it affects the data integrity and accuracy altogether.
These datasets contain high level of _inconsistencies_, _duplicates_, _missing values_ and _formatting issues_ that has to be cleaned before processing.

For the **First Dataset** which **Movie Box Office Data** (Check the __**image below**__ for a snapshot of the unclean dataset)

<p align="left">
  <img width="624" height="622" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dataset%201.png">

  <img width="286" height="456" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dataset%201-1.png">
</p>

The **Underlying Issues** are:
-	Inconsistent currency formatting.
-	Typos in data entries (e.g., "20a7").
-	Missing values for some fields.
-	Duplicate movie entries.
-	Blank spaces in names.

---

For the **Second Dataset** which is **Audience Demographic Data** (Check the **_image below_** for a snapshot of the unclean dataset)
<p align="left">
  <img width="612" height="864" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dataset%202.png">

  <img width="335" height="316" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dataset%202-1.png">
</p>


The **Underlying Issues** are:
-	Inconsistent gender labels (e.g., "M", "Male"). 
-	Invalid Movie ID entries. 
-	Missing values for age and rating. 
-	Typos in Rating values. 
-	Inconsistent viewing of platform names.

For the **Third Dataset Critical Reviews Data** (Check the **_image below_** for a snapshot of the unclean dataset)

<p align="left">
  <img width="624" height="717" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dataset%203.png">

  <img width="427" height="427" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Dataset%203-1.png">
</p>

The Underlying Issues are:
-	Inconsistent date formats. 
-	Missing critic names. 
-	Invalid dates (e.g., "2017-13-05"). 
-	Missing or incorrect review scores. 

---

## Data Cleaning Approach: 
The dirty data with its inaccuracies CANNOT be used for analysis just like that. It has to undergo some level of cleaning for it to be fit for analysis.
One of such approach to do this is using the Power Query Features in Excel. 

Through Power Query, Key issues with each dataset was addressed:
-	Standardized currency formatting in box office data
-	Fixed incorrect data entries (e.g., ‘20a7’ → ‘2017’ in release year)

<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="375" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Cleaning%201.png">
</p>

-	Handled missing values with appropriate imputation methods-( One of such method I used was to replace missing numeric values with the mean/average of the column).
For the categorical variables, for example, the missing values in **Gender**, **Directors** & **Lead Actor** were replaced with words like **“Others”**, **“Unknown”** respectively.

<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="368" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Cleaning%202.png">
</p>

-	Removed duplicate entries
-	Standardized audience demographics labels (‘M’, ‘Male’ → ‘Male’)

<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="331" src="https://github.com/anuhimustee/GlowStream-Media-Analysis/blob/main/ReadMe%20Images/Cleaning%203.png">
</p>

-	Formatted inconsistent date formats

## Data Modelling

Fundamentally, as a data analyst, a comprehensive understanding of each dataset shows that there is or should be a relationship between the three datasets.
The datasets were structured in a relational format:
-	Movie Box Office Data (Primary Key: Movie ID)
-	Audience Demographics Data (Foreign Key: Movie ID)
-	Critical Reviews Data (Foreign Key: Movie ID)
The presence of these key columns as Primary and Foreign Key suggests a relationship and hence this was done through Power Pivot as shown in the image below.
