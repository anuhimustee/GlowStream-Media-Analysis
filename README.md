# Introduction

Hey! It's me again Anuhi Mustapha.

Truth be told, Netflix is one of the biggest streaming platforms out there and they are really making big waves and massive moves. Not just that, the entertainment industry is constantly growing and the most interesting is that data (unprocessed information) as I like to call it) plays a crucial role in decision-making. 
In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst at GlowStream Media, a private entertainment company planning to launch a new show by analyzing the trends and performance of blockbuster movies from 2015-2023. Unlike typical movie review shows, GlowStream wants to avoid subjective opinions and focus on data-driven insights. They aim to explore themes like box office performance, audience demographics, critical receptions, and streaming platform popularity.

 For this project, some numbers of questions were answered using Excel analysis features like pivot table, conditional formatting, etc
